0. the perl script /proj/rac/ops/SOHO/get_sw.pl is run daily by cron.
   It fetches solar wind data from ACE SWEPAM and SOHO MTOF archives on the WWW

1. run perl script: print_sw.pl > solwin.dat
   solwin.dat contains SWEPAM and MTOF measurements and predictions vs linear date.

2. run plot_sw.pro to compare measurements and predictions of solar wind data.
